### GDPR Security Migration
{: #gdpr-visrec-update}

- All {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionfull}} service instances created before **May 22, 2018** are not suitable for clients that require compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation EU 2016/679 (GDPR).
- Clients that are subject to GDPR need to [migrate to a new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service instance](/docs/services/visual-recognition?topic=visual-recognition-migrating#migrating) available on **May 22nd, 2018** and to adopt the new agreement for the {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service.
- Clients are required to provision a new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service and generate *new authentication keys* to utilize the new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service.
- If a client does not provision the new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service, you confirm that IBM is not processing any Personal Data on the client's behalf that is subject to the GDPR.
- Clients who do not move to the new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service between May 22, 2018 and October 1, 2018 will have their data deleted.

### Labeling data

If you need to remove an individual customer's data from a {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service instance with multiple customers, you first need to associate that data with a unique customer ID for each individual that might have provided data.

To specify the customer ID for any data that is sent with the **Create a classifier**, **Create a collection**, or **Update a collection** method, include the **X-Watson-Metadata: customer_id** property in the request header. The following example for the v3 API associates the customer ID `my_ID` with a request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
--header "X-Watson-Metadata: customer_id=my_ID" \
--form "apple_positive_examples=@apples.zip" \
"https://api.us-south.visual-recognition.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/87ff6c52-1c87-46d7-ad18-4ba7ce033760/v3/classifiers?version=2018-03-19"
```
{: pre}

Multi-byte characters are supported for the customer ID string. Characters must be URL-encoded, both in the header during training, and in the query parameter during deletion. The ID can contain alphanumeric and underscore (`_`) characters. These characters are not supported: ``\ | * { } $ - [ ] / ' ` " ~ ? ; < > ( ) ! & = % # ^ @ : . , + space``.

You are responsible for creating customer ID values, and ensuring that each is unique.
{: important}

### Deleting labeled data

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} plans: To remove processed images that might have been stored within the system to expedite subsequent training of your custom classifiers, create a support ticket for the "right to be forgotten", and request the deletion. See [GDPR Subject Access Request](/docs/services/watson?topic=watson-gdpr-sar#request-EU){: external}.
{: note}

To delete all data that is associated with a customer ID, use the **Delete labeled data** method. You pass the string `customer_id={id}` as a query parameter with the request. The following example for the v3 API deletes all data for the customer ID `my_ID`:

```bash
curl -X DELETE -u "apikey:{apikey}" \
"https://api.us-south.visual-recognition.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/87ff6c52-1c87-46d7-ad18-4ba7ce033760/v3/user_data?customer_id=my_ID&version=2018-03-19"
```
{: pre}

The **Delete labeled data** method deletes all data that is associated with the specified customer ID, regardless of the method by which the information was added. The method has no effect if no data is associated with the customer ID.

Delete requests are processed in batches and might take up to 24 hours to complete.
